# Security Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and best practices for the JinBean app to prevent data leaks and ensure secure handling of sensitive information.

## Data Security Strategy

### 1. Environment Variables Management

#### ✅ Secure Approach
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Never hardcode API keys, URLs, or credentials
- Use `String.fromEnvironment()` for Flutter apps

#### ❌ Avoid
```dart
// DON'T: Hardcode sensitive information
static const String apiKey = 'sk-1234567890abcdef';
static const String databaseUrl = 'https://my-db.com';
```

#### ✅ Correct Implementation
```dart
// DO: Use environment variables
static const String apiKey = String.fromEnvironment(
  'API_KEY',
  defaultValue: '',
);
```

### 2. API Security

#### Authentication
- Use secure authentication methods (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- Implement token-based authentication
- Store tokens securely using Flutter Secure Storage

#### API Endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all input data
- Use proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### 3. Data Storage Security

#### Local Storage
- Use Flutter Secure Storage for sensitive data
- Encrypt sensitive information before storage
- Clear sensitive data when app is uninstalled

#### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits

### 4. Network Security

#### HTTPS Only
- All network requests must use HTTPS
- Implement certificate pinning for critical endpoints
- Validate SSL certificates

#### Data Transmission
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit
- Use secure protocols (TLS 1.2+)
- Implement proper error handling

### 5. Code Security

#### Secrets Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management
- Rotate keys regularly

#### Code Review
- Regular security code reviews
- Static analysis tools
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
